it has two step 

suppose our parent component name is app  (app) 
and child component name is A  

then for connecting child component A to parent component app we have two step 

1. connect A component in app.html 

<app-a></app-a>

2. import Component A in import [] section of app.ts file because i want to inject Component A to Component app

inside app.ts

imports: [RouterOutlet, ComponentA],


// and thats it now we can see whatever we are writing inside component A.html it is visible to App.html because A.html is injecting inside App.html
